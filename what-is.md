While Azure is made of **subscriptions, resource groups, resources**, Enterprise IT is made of **departments, users, roles, development teams, projects, environments, assets**.

Bigger is the enterprise more is made also of on-premises assets and mashup of services on more than one public cloud.

* *Who is responsible for...*
* *Where are located the service of...*
* *Who is the administrator of...*
* *Where is the SharePoint site for the project...*
* *Is there any SR open for...*
* *Which are the IT assets of...*
* *What is the documentation for the API...*

are the type of questions IT should be able to answer and that employees ask for. Corelations between all these entities are typically well defined in the Enterprise but doesn't exist a one-fit-all co-relation diagram that connect everything.

Google have demonstrated the full text search can work as entrypoint for everything on internet, why this can't work also in an Enterprise?

# Introducing: WhoIsWho

WhoIsWho is **a unified and handy view of all enterprise IT assets and his connections, costs, point of contacts, managers, documentation**.

WhoIsWho is an open-source extendible design based on Azure Cognitive search that can be tailored on any enterprise organization. A well defined pattern to include more data entity and corelate each other
a SPA search based app gives a starting point and a reference architecture to integrate and corelate all IT assets. An API is also available for integrating WhoIsWho data in 3th party applications.
